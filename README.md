## Brainstorm

- [ ] Message length bar with a box (??) graph
- [ ] Biggest spammer (if there was spams)
- [ ] The one who left/rejoined the most.
- [ ] Custom swear count
- [ ] Github heatmap style for active days
- [ ] Fastest rolling messaegs (display the time and a simulation probably on the time where the messages were flowing fastest)
- [ ] Graph the interactions of each person with each other, seing the favourite duos and who interacts with everyone

### Easier ones

- [ ] Avarage characters per message (make it a weighted avarage, meaning one or two huge texts do not alter the avg my that much)
- [ ] Group timespan
- [ ] Total words and characters spoken
- [ ] Emojis used, in total, and per person graph
- [ ] Most used emojis graph
- [ ] Longest streak
- [ ] Longest moment of silence (the dry age)

### Other

- [ ] Make the stat parser function, which automatically returns an object to easily reference all the stats.
